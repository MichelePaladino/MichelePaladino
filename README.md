### Hey, hi there 👋
## I am Michele! Nice to meet you 👨‍💼
How cool is this new feature? 🚀 I love fun easter eggs like this one!


Well, you probably don't have the whole day to chit-chat, so let's get to the point. 

You are here to know more about me, so...

---

My most ambitious project is [MTG Builders](https://mtg.builders).


It's a SaaS that I have solo-developed!
I wrote [a series of articles](https://www.michelepaladino.dev/articles/building-mtg-builders-part-one) describing the journey that led to its creation.

It was a fun, long road full of obstacles, and bugs 🐛, and problems, and bugs 🐛!

So 🐛 many 🐛 bugs 🐛 !

But that's what I love actually, finding a cool place for this bugs to chill! Just, not in my software...

I hope I will hear from you! Reach out to me on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, wherever!

Send me an email, an owl- let's have a coffee here in Manhattan! Have you tried the new Pistachio Latte at Starbucks?
